## Development guide

The original simulations are written in ActionScript 2.0. To open the .fla files, you'll need an older version of Adobe Animate than the current version (19.1). You can download a trial version of Adobe Flash Professional CS4 [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/cs4-product-downloads.html)
and open the .fla files with this. Also, Flash Professional CS6 can also open these files. Adobe doesn't distribute Flash Professional anymore. The only way I've found to read the source files is by opening the .swf files in [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler
](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler).

To get to the code, go to Window -> Actions. The bottom-left panel
should have the code hierarchy. 

Here are instructions on how to develop and make changes to these simulations. If you're using Windows, replace the forward slashes with back-slashes.

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone this repository
* Go into one of the simulations, e.g.: `cd astro-simulations/lunar-phase-simulator`
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run serve`
* Wait for the build to complete. It takes a while.
* Open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

You can also use the `npm run dev` command if all you want to do is
make a development build of a simulation without using
[webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). Three.js
has an overview of this in [How to run things locally](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally).
Both `npm run dev` and `npm run serve` watch the `src/` directory for file
changes.

Here are some blog posts I've made about these simulations:
* [How to animate graphical JavaScript programs](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/articles/how-to-animate-graphical-javascript-programs/)
* [How to make an analog clock (Part 1)](https://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2018/9/27.html)
* [How to work with Planes in three.js](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/articles/planes-in-threejs/)
* [How to make a draggable dialog box in JavaScript](https://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2019/4/26.html)

There's also the [Conversion Guide](https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/docs/conversion-guide.html)
 that documents how to put together a new interactive.
